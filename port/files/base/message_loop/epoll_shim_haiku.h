// Haiku has poll() but neither epoll nor kqueue, and Chromium removed its
// libevent pump, so message_pump_for_io.h maps every POSIX platform to
// MessagePumpEpoll.
//
// That pump already contains a complete poll() implementation --
// GetEventsPoll(), guarded by the kUsePollForMessagePumpEpoll feature, added
// for Android's scheduler behaviour rather than for portability. On that path
// epoll_event is used only as a plain struct to carry results, and the EPOLL*
// values only as bit flags mapped to and from the POLL* ones.
//
// So all Haiku needs is the type and the constants. The pump is compiled with
// its epoll_create/epoll_ctl/epoll_wait calls left out and the poll path
// forced on; see the changes to message_pump_epoll.{h,cc}.
//
// The bit values are the Linux ones. Nothing here is passed to a kernel: they
// are only compared against each other and against the kEpollToPollEvents
// table, so what matters is that they are distinct.
